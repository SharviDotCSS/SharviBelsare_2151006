Case Study: College Management System
In a college management system, there are various entities and functionalities that need to 
be implemented to manage students, courses, and enrollment. Below are the main entities 
and their relationships:
 Student:
• Attributes: Student ID, Name, Email, Phone Number, Address
• Students can enroll in multiple courses.
 Course:
• Attributes: Course ID, Course Name, Instructor, Credits, Maximum Capacity
• Courses can have multiple students enrolled.
 Enrollment:
• Attributes: Enrollment ID, Student ID, Course ID, Enrollment Date
• Represents the enrollment of a student in a course.
 CollegeManager:
 This class should manage students, courses, and enrollments.
 Functionalities:
• Add a student to the system.
• Add a course to the system.
• Enroll a student in a course.
• Display the list of students enrolled in a particular course.
• Display the list of courses a student is enrolled in.


Programming Questions:
Question 1: Student and Course Management
Write a Java program that implements the Student and Course classes. You should be able 
to create instances of these classes, set their attributes, and display their information. 
Additionally, implement a method to check if a course is full (reached its maximum 
capacity).
Question 2: Enrollment Management
Extend the program from Question 1 to include the Enrollment class and implement the ability 
to enroll a student in a course. Ensure that the program prevents enrolling a student in a 
course if it has reached its maximum capacity.
Question 3: CollegeManager Implementation
Create a CollegeManager class that utilizes the Student, Course, and Enrollment classes to 
manage the college system. Implement methods in the CollegeManager class to:
• Add students to the system.
• Add courses to the system.
• Enroll students in courses.
• Display the list of students enrolled in a particular course.
• Display the list of courses a student is enrolled in.
➢ Write a Java program that demonstrates the functionality of the CollegeManager 
class by adding students and courses, enrolling students in courses, and displaying 
relevant information.
